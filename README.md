# YOLOv8 Implementation with Roboflow Dataset

This project implements YOLOv8 for object detection and segmentation and bytetrack ufor object tracking on a custom dataset prepared from Roboflow.

## Overview

This repository contains the code to train, validate, and run inference on YOLOv8 models using a custom dataset obtained from Roboflow. The project aims to demonstrate the end-to-end process of training YOLOv8 for object detection and segmentation and tasks.

## Features

- Train YOLOv8 models with custom datasets from Roboflow
- Validate model performance
- Run inference on images using trained models

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download your custom dataset from Roboflow and organize it as per the project structure.
4. Start training, validation, or inference using the provided scripts.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these instructions:

1. Configure the dataset location and model parameters in the configuration files.
2. Use the provided scripts to train, validate, or run inference on YOLOv8 models.
3. Refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions and command-line options.

## Examples
